I also want to explain myself, because I didn't use version control for the vast time during project. I just used to do projects on my own and didn't make habit of commiting progress to repository. (But I know how to use (lets say basics) of git). I know it is a huge disatvantage of this project, but I hope it will not disqualify me - using git was not pointed in application requirements.
